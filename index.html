        there are other designs mixed in including previews of what pressing each radio button option will result in,

              <li>
                Upon searching a keyword using the search bar, a series of filters appears at the top of the search results. 
                One clicks on the “Filter” tool, which makes a radio button selection appear. 
              </li>
              <li>
                You can click on every content option by either using the radio button itself on the right hand side. 
                The clickable target area is larger including the options’ words (e.g. Videos) which makes it easier for 
                users to interact with. The chosen option’s word also becomes bolded.
              </li>
              <li>
                The radio button filter is only applied once users hit “Apply” at the bottom of the side menu. 
                This is not intuitive at first since this button appears to be separate from the radio button selection, 
                as visually it is much further down the sidebar menu.

              </li>
              <li>
                When hovering between options, users don’t have to hover over the number, rather the entire container option works. 
                The container is much larger than the numbers & each label tag making it more accessible to different mouse users.
              </li>
              <li>
                When clicking on a button, the drop shadow disappears until the click is released.
                This makes the container bounce when clicked on, adding an additional queue to users.
              </li>
              <li>
                Once one option is selected, users have no way of clicking away back to the initial state. 
                This increases learnability as it’s signaled to users they must submit one of the radio button options.

                This increases learnability as users are automatically able to grasp that they must select one of the options. Having a default selected option can help. 
              </li>
              <li>
                For the color selection, the color of the button itself aligns with the selection increasing memorability of the component.

                All the radio buttons have default choices set, which helps users understand that they can select the other options, by clicking over the image.

                The classic looking radio buttons are the hardest to click on because of small text size and button size.

                Choosing between the radio buttons with Pageup and Pagedown keys only works when the radio buttons are activated first with a mouse press.

              <li>
                As a standalone feature it misses the connection between opening the radio buttons, and then being able to use them.

      <h4> I now revised my state models, making an intentional trade-off that affects how we value 
        the components' learnability, memorability, efficiency, and accessibility. 
        This could mean making the component more usable for screen reader and keyboard users
        rather than for repeated mouse users, which is a design trade-off for those users.

        The main change is that when keyboard users want to escape the selection they may do so by hitting the escape button.
        This does however mean that whenever mouse users stop their selection and click elsewhere on the screen, the selection will 
        refresh and they will have to restart choosing which radio button.

            Having one preselected option may help first-time users understand that one needs to be selected. The additional proposal of having 
            the buttons rotate in being highlighted helps learnability and memorability. First-time users can understand that they can toggle 
            between options as much as they like.

          <h5>
            I eliminated an unneccessary workflow with the "Clear All" button. Clicking on this button would bring users back to the "All Pins" button 
            within the radio selection. The design can simply have the "All Pins" without this additional button, as clearing does 
            not actually clear the selection it just brings
            users back to the default option. As for learnability, using a border like Duolingo to signify the total clickable area makes it 
            more obvious which button is selected and where mouse users can click.

        </h3>
        <h4>
          Key Guiding Questions:
          <li>
            Where did the components you observed do well in terms of usability and accessibility? How have you applied this to your design?
          </li>

            Are there accessibility considerations that were not addressed that you accounted for in your own design?
          </li>
          <li>
            How does the change you’ve made in your own design solve for a “mismatch” in our world?
          </li>
        </h4>

        <h5>
          Some key takeaways include: The components observed across Duolingo, Pinterest, and Apple’s Settings had 
          different strengths in usability and accessibility. For example, Pinterest’s radio buttons extended 
          the clickable area beyond just the button, including the text label, making selection easier.
          Duolingo provided a large clickable area and better keyboard navigation compared to the other two implementations.
          I applied Duolingo's boxed clickable areas to redesigning Pinterest's interaction.
          Apple Settings was the most creative with their interpretations of radio buttons. Their designs also set default states
          signify to new users that a mutually exclusive selection must be made.
        </h5>
        <h5> There were many accessibility concerns that were not addressed in my design exploration. 
          In the case of Apple Settings for instance, most of the keyboard functionalities were lacking. 
          This redesign would include redesigning multiple interactions at once as I was looking at a page with multiple 
          different radio button types used. Most importantly, as we saw with the trade-off exercise, it's hard to
          address some design elements that make it easier for keyboard users, but then change mouse functionalities.
        </h5>
        <h5>
          Kat Holmes’ concept of "mismatch" highlights how design choices can exclude users with different abilities. 
          A major mismatch I identified was the lack of a way to deselect a previously selected option in most designs. 
          This limitation forced users to always have a selection, 
          which might not align with all use cases. My design includes an explicit way to "clear selection" in the trade-off section to allow users more flexibility.
        </h5>

        <h4>
          Going back my exploration, I want to give two examples of how the accessibility/inaccessibility of those inputs or outputs 
          could also impact users with impairments either positively or negatively.
          The major accessibility issue observed was limited keyboard navigation. 
          Many of the tested interfaces did not allow full navigation via keyboard alone, 
          making them inaccessible for users who rely on assistive technologies. 
          In my design, I ensured that users could navigate the radio buttons using only the keyboard 
          (arrow keys, Enter key for selection, and Esc to clear the selection if applicable).

          When evaluating interaction costs, the size of the target is crucial. 
          Since radio buttons are naturally small, they can be difficult to click or tap. 
          Expanding the target area improves usability, making selection easier. 
          Users should be able to select an option not only by clicking the circle but also by clicking the associated label.
        </h4>

          This exploration has taught me that mouse users are of top priority in the process of designing components. 
          This has clearly been displayed in the case of radio buttons, where it's hard to transfer that same level 
          of intiution for first time users and maintain learnability for keyboard users for instance. 
          Touch and mobile is easier to adjust for a component like Radio Buttons. It's hard to transfer the 
          mutually exlusive nature of radio buttons to screenreaders for instance, as they may only read each word
          individually rather than as a list of options. This has a major impact on users outside of the mouse interaction.
